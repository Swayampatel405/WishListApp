# WishListApp
WishListApp is an Android application built using Kotlin and Room database. It allows users to add, modify, and delete their wishes seamlessly. The app features a swipe-to-delete functionality, making it user-friendly and efficient. This project showcases my exploration of data storage with Room and the use of various Kotlin dependencies.
